    <!-- 
      The alt text helps blind visitors and displays to everyone when 
      the image can otherwise not be found. 

      The title gives a tooltip on hover.  It helps with SEO, but lacks accessibility; 
      it's preferable to use the alt field and include any other relevant information
      in the main text of the page.

      Adding the height and width attributes tells the browser to leave that amount of 
      designated space for the image, which can save on load time. However, do not use these 
      attributes to manipulate the image size; use CSS for that.

        The browser will go through the source elements and play the first one that it has
        the codec to support.  The type attribute can be read immediately by the browser; 
        without it, the browser will attempt to load and play every source video, leading 
        to slower performance
